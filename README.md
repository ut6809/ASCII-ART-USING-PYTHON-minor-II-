# ASCII Art – Sania Mirza

This is a simple Python project that prints an ASCII art picture of **Sania Mirza** in the terminal using only basic Python concepts.

## Project Aim

- Practice Python basics
- Use loops and conditional statements
- Create a text-based image using characters like `*`, `#`, `%`, `+`, `-`, `:`

## What the Program Does

- Prints a header
- Uses a `for` loop to go through row numbers
- Uses `if / elif` for each row to print the correct ASCII line
- Shows a “complete” message at the end

## Python Topics Used

- `print()` statements  
- Strings and special characters  
- `for` loop with `range()`  
- `if / elif` conditional statements  
- Function definition and `if __name__ == "__main__":`

## How to Run

1. Install Python 3 on your system.
2. Save the code as `sania_mirza_ascii.py`.
3. Open terminal / CMD in that folder.
4. Run:

   ```bash
   python sania_mirza_ascii.py

You will see Sania Mirza’s ASCII art printed line by line in the terminal.
